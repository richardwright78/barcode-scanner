# Getting Started with Create React App

This is a basic proof of concept for a barcode scanning app using react-qr-barcode-scanner https://github.com/jamenamcinteer/react-qr-barcode-scanner.

The app consist of a home page, a scan document page, and a scan results page that simply dislays the barcode that has been scanned.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
